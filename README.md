Our fire detection UAV is engineered to combat wildfires worldwide. Powered by an Arduino Uno brain, our drone is equipped with sensors including a passive buzzer, flame sensor, and thermal imaging to detect fires. The glider design is designed to achieve a lift to drag ratio of 60:1, ensuring long-range missions with endurance. This drone aims to minimize the pressing threat that wildfires are.

I was very lucky to have the pportunity to participate in a Shark Tank-style competition where our team presented our prototype for a wildfire-fighting drone.

We were able to present in front of esteemed judges: Professor Pim Oomen, Ph.D., Adrian Bahani, Engineer at Rockley Photonics, and CEO/Founder of UpKeep, Ryan Chen.
